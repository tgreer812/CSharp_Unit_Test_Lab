# C# Unit Testing Lab Skeleton

This repository contains the starting point for a handsâ€‘on unit testing lab using **MSTest**. The project grows through a series of guided parts. Each part lives under `LabUnitTesting/docs` with instructions.

## Structure

```
LabUnitTesting/
  BusinessLogic/           # Class library under test
  BusinessLogic.Tests/     # MSTest project
  LabUnitTesting.sln       # Solution tying projects together
  docs/                    # Step-by-step instructions
```

Begin with **docs/Part0_Setup.md** and work through the parts in order. Refer to **docs/Frameworks_At_A_Glance.md** for a comparison of popular .NET test frameworks.
